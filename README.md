# Discord Bot with Flask

This project synchronizes between a simple HTML form input text box and a Discord server. Once the user inserts a message into the browser, the Discord bot automatically shows it in the Discord server.
By going to the route of ```/get_messages``` the discord bot will present all the messages from the last 30 minutes.

## Installing

1. Install Flask by writing the command: ```pip install Flask```
2. Install discordwebhook by writing the command: ```pip install discordwebhook```
